# DMS Workspace

Dividend Management System (DMS) - An application for managing Dividend based investing built with Angular and Node.js.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a Dividend Management System (DMS), primarily using Closed End Funds (CEFs),built using Angular for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The application allows users to manage their dividend investments, track payments, and analyze performance.

What set this apart from typical systems is that we are not focused on "Total Returns" (ie, what the theoretical value of the portfolio is including unrealized gains/losses) but rather the amount of money invested and the dividends it generates. This is a different mindset and requires a different approach to portfolio management.

## A Work In Progress

While this application serves a purpose for my own uses, and you are welcome to use it and modify it as you see fit, please be aware that:

- The codebase is still a work in progress. In fact, the DMS application was my initial attempt at building this application using PrimeNg components. I found that they do not support the lazy loading of data very well so I'm moving to Angular Material components instead in DMS-Material. 
- Aside from creating the application, I had several purposes for creating this application:
  - Learn PrimeNg and Tailwind CSS
  - Learn some more about AWS and Docker deployments
  - Learn how to write an entire application using AI.
  - Provide an additional example of how to use SmartSignals in an application.
