# Component Best Practices

- Do not specify `standalone: true` in component decorators, as it is the default.
- Use signals for all inputs, outputs, and any variable accessed by the template.
- Never use inline HTML or SCSS in components; always use external files.

# Component Architecture Rules
When components exceed 250 lines or contain multiple private utility methods, extract functionality into viewProvider services:
- Move localStorage operations to dedicated storage services
- Extract complex validation logic into validation services
- Separate data transformation logic into transformer services
- Use viewProviders array to inject services: `viewProviders: [MyService]`
- Keep components focused on UI logic and user interactions
- Services should handle business logic, data persistence, and utility operations
