# **2. UI Changes**

The primary change to the user interface involves simplifying the modal dialog.

* **Removal of Elements**: The input fields for symbols (equities, income, and tax-free) will be removed from the modal dialog. This simplifies the dialog's appearance and interaction model.
* **Button State**: The "Update Universe" button will be enabled by default when the dialog loads. It will no longer depend on the symbol input fields to be in a valid state.
* **Modal Buttons**: The other existing buttons in the modal will be retained.
