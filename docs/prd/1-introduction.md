# **1. Introduction**

This PRD outlines the requirements for a brownfield enhancement to the existing application. The goal is to modernize the process for updating the universe of tradable Closed End Funds (CEFs) by replacing the manual symbol input fields with an automated process that leverages the results of the Screener. This enhancement will streamline the user workflow and improve efficiency while retaining the existing dialog functionality.
