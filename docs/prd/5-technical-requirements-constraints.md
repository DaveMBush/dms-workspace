# **5. Technical Requirements & Constraints**

- **Frontend**: The frontend code for this enhancement must be written in **Angular 20** using **signals**. The use of **RxJS should be avoided**. The user interface will leverage the existing **PrimeNG component library** and **Tailwind CSS** for styling and layout.
- **Backend**: The backend services must integrate with the existing stack, which uses the **Prisma ORM framework** with **Sqlite3** and the **better-sqlite3** driver. The API interface is built with the **Fastify framework**.
- **General**: All new and modified code must strictly adhere to the project's established **lint rules** for both the frontend and backend.
