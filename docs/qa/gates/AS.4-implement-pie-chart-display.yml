  All 13 acceptance criteria met. GREEN phase complete with 12 TDD tests re-enabled and passing.
  95.4% code coverage (53/53 statements, 22/22 declarations). Clean signal-based architecture,
  proper currency-formatted tooltips, color consistency verified, empty state handled.
  Two low-severity advisory items noted (empty state canvas overlap, 4 uncovered branches) —
  neither blocking.
