  notes:
    - Angular text interpolation provides automatic XSS protection
    - Proper ARIA dialog structure using Material Dialog
    - Focus trapping implemented via CDK
    - Modal behavior prevents background interaction
    - Comprehensive edge case coverage in unit tests

uncovered_edge_cases:
  - Multiple dialogs stacking (documented as rare edge case)
  - Enter key confirmation (not implemented, minor UX gap)
  - Dialog animation timing (not explicitly tested)
  - Custom icon support (not implemented)
  - Danger/destructive styling option (not implemented)
