- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Code formatting applied
- ✅ Duplication check passed (0.08%)

### Technical Assessment
- ✅ Proper use of Angular signals for reactivity
- ✅ Efficient computed signal filtering
- ✅ Maintainable code structure
- ✅ Follows SmartNgRX patterns

### Risk Assessment
- **Probability**: Low - Standard SmartNgRX integration
- **Impact**: Low - Component-level change with full test coverage
- **Overall Risk**: Low

## Recommendations
None - implementation is production-ready.

## Next Steps
Ready for commit and deployment.
