# **1\. User Flow**

The user flow for updating the universe will be streamlined to a single-step action within the modal dialog.

1. The user navigates to the screen that contains the "Update Universe" modal dialog.
2. The user clicks a button to open the dialog.
3. The modal dialog appears, now without the manual symbol input fields.
4. The "Update Universe" button is no longer disabled and is immediately clickable.
5. The user clicks the "Update Universe" button to trigger the process.
6. The modal dialog closes upon a successful API call, and the application's universe of CEFs is updated in the backend.
