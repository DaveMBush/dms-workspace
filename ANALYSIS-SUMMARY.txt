================================================================================
MIGRATION EFFORT: 10-16 BUSINESS DAYS
================================================================================

Phase 1: Setup (1-2 days)                     - Material config, theme setup
Phase 2: Forms (1-2 days)                     - Login, inputs, validation
Phase 3: Basic Components (1-2 days)          - Buttons, cards, lists
Phase 4: Tables (3-5 days) ** CRITICAL **     - Editable tables, sorting
Phase 5: Advanced (1-2 days)                  - Dialogs, date pickers
Phase 6: Polish & Testing (2-3 days)          - Tests, accessibility, styles

KEY CHALLENGES:
  1. Table architecture change (template-driven → column definitions)
  2. Inline cell editing (requires custom implementation)
  3. Notification service API change (MessageService → MatSnackBar)
  4. Splitter layout (no direct Material equivalent)
  5. Icon migration (PrimeIcons → Material Icons)

================================================================================
COMPONENT MIGRATION COMPLEXITY MATRIX
================================================================================

HIGHEST PRIORITY (Complex, Start Last):
  ✗ OpenPositionsComponent (editable data table - 3-5 days)
  ✗ GlobalUniverseComponent (large table with real-time sync - 3-5 days)
  ✗ SoldPositionsComponent (complex table - 2-3 days)
  ✗ Shell component (main layout with toolbar, panels - 2-3 days)

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Moderate Complexity):
  ~ DividendDeposits (lazy-loaded table - 2 days)
  ~ Screener (data grid with filtering - 1-2 days)
  ~ Login & Auth forms (1-2 days)
  ~ Profile & dialogs (1-2 days)

LOWEST PRIORITY (Simple, Start First):
  ✓ Button components (1 hour each)
  ✓ Card components (30 mins each)
  ✓ InputText/InputNumber (30 mins each)
  ✓ Utility components (30 mins each)

================================================================================
KEY ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. STANDALONE COMPONENTS:
   All components use standalone: true (implicit) - no module file needed.
   Simplifies migration as no module declarations to update.

2. SIGNALS-BASED STATE:
   Heavy use of Angular signals and computed signals throughout.
   SmartNgRX handles all entity data, works independently of UI library.
   MessageService/ConfirmationService are only UI-specific services.

3. LAZY-LOADED ROUTES:
   Smart route-level SmartNgRX provider setup enables code splitting.
   Feature stores provided at route level, not globally.
   Doesn't affect migration approach.

4. ABSTRACT BASE CLASSES:
   BasePositionsComponent, BasePositionsTableComponent abstract shared logic.
   Table migration in one place benefits multiple components.

5. SHARED CONSTANTS:
   POSITIONS_COMMON_IMPORTS constant reduces duplication.
   Update once → applies to multiple components.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED MIGRATION APPROACH
================================================================================

STRATEGY: Phased, bottom-up with both libraries coexisting initially

WHY:
  - De-risks the migration
  - Allows parallel work
  - Incremental testing possible
  - Can revert if needed

SEQUENCE:
  1. Setup Material + keep PrimeNG (both active)
  2. Migrate lowest-risk components first (buttons, inputs)
  3. Migrate shared infrastructure next (unblocks features)
  4. Migrate navigation/layout (enables pages)
  5. Tackle tables (highest complexity)
  6. Final polish and cleanup
  7. Remove PrimeNG dependency

TEAM ALLOCATION:
  - 1 Lead: Migration planning, complex tables, Material expertise
  - 2-3 Developers: Component migration in parallel
  - 1 QA: Testing each phase
  - Optional: 1 Designer for theme/styling

TESTING APPROACH:
  - Unit tests: Update selectors, use Material testing harnesses
  - E2E tests: Update page object selectors
  - Visual tests: Screenshot comparison for styling
  - Accessibility: axe DevTools audit after each phase

================================================================================
CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
================================================================================

1. Material expertise on team (especially for tables/CDK)
2. Test environment setup with both libraries
3. Design system documentation (colors, spacing, etc.)
4. Clear component migration checklist
5. Regular stakeholder communication
6. Post-migration accessibility audit

================================================================================
RISK SUMMARY
================================================================================

Technical Risks:
  - Table complexity (Medium-High): Mitigate with POC in Phase 1
  - Splitter layout (Low-Medium): Design custom solution early
  - Theme/dark mode (Low): Test early in setup phase
  - Performance: Keep monitoring, shouldn't be impacted

Schedule Risks:
  - Table migration underestimated: Allocate 5 days, not 3
  - Staff churn: Document clearly, enable knowledge transfer
  - Scope creep: Stick to like-for-like replacement, no redesign

Data/Integration Risks:
  - Very low: UI library change doesn't affect SmartNgRX or services
  - Keep Chart.js as-is (no Material equivalent)
  - Auth system unchanged (AWS Amplify independent)

================================================================================
NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS
================================================================================

1. Review DMS-FRONTEND-ANALYSIS.md (15-20 min read)
2. Review DMS-MIGRATION-QUICK-REFERENCE.md (10-15 min read)
3. Assess team Material expertise (day 1)
4. Create Material POC with basic forms & tables (day 2-3)
5. Validate table approach with complex example (day 4-5)
6. Plan sprint allocation and timeline (day 5-6)
7. Begin Phase 1 (Material setup) (day 7)

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The DMS application is well-structured and organized, making it a good
candidate for UI library migration. The main complexity is in data tables,
but with proper planning and expertise, a 2-3 week migration timeline is
realistic.

The use of standalone components and SmartNgRX signals for state management
means the migration is primarily a UI layer concern - business logic remains
untouched.

Start with the provided documentation, conduct a POC for complex components
(especially tables), allocate appropriate expertise, and proceed in phases.

Good luck with the migration!
