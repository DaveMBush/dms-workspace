# Architecture Decision Document

_This document builds collaboratively through step-by-step discovery. Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._

---

## Project Context Analysis

### Requirements Overview

**Functional Requirements:**
FR1–FR35 from the PRD are fully implemented in the current MVP. The 8 epics in scope add zero
new functional behaviour. All work targets NFR improvement: maintainability, reliability, performance,
accessibility, and testability of the existing feature set.

**Non-Functional Requirements driving this epic set:**

- NFR-Maintainability: Remove dead code (E1), strengthen lint rules (E4), migrate CSS to Tailwind conventions (E5), upgrade Tailwind v4 (E6)
- NFR-Reliability: Enable skipped tests to restore full test coverage ≥ 88% (E3), fix CUSIP lookup failures (E2)
- NFR-Performance: Tailwind v4 reduces CSS bundle overhead; dead code removal reduces JS bundle
- NFR-Accessibility: Dark-mode correctness on CUSIP Cache page (E7), visual regression baseline (E8)
- NFR-Testability: Storybook per-component isolation + Playwright visual regression pipeline (E8)

**Scale & Complexity:**

- Primary domain: Full-stack SPA (Angular 21 + Fastify) — brownfield improvement sprint
- Complexity level: Medium — no new data models, API routes, or authentication flows
- Estimated architectural components: 4 major subsystems affected (Angular build pipeline, ESLint config, CSS layer system, CI pipeline)

---

### Technical Constraints & Dependencies

1. **Angular 21 zoneless + SmartNgRX must not be disturbed** — all new code must follow `inject()` pattern, `OnPush`, signal-first state, and the mandatory TDD ordering: ATDD story (write failing tests, set to skip) → Implementation story (un-skip tests, implement). Sprint planning must reflect this pairing for all 33 stories.

2. **Storybook 8 + Angular 21 + Vite (@analogjs) — ADR-001:**

   - Use `@storybook/angular` with `@storybook/builder-vite`.
   - Thread `@analogjs/vite-plugin-angular` through `viteFinal` in `.storybook/main.ts` — do not re-register it independently.
   - **Display-only components (Story 8.2):** pass data directly via `input()` signal values — no store wiring needed.
   - **Page components (Story 8.3):** use mock `EffectService` via `applicationConfig`, mirroring the TestBed unit test pattern. `provideSmartFeatureSignalEntities()` cannot be used directly — it requires a live Angular Router context.
   - MSW (Mock Service Worker) deferred unless a specific page component cannot be stubbed via EffectService.
   - **CI strategy:** Step 1 = `pnpm storybook:build`, Step 2 = `serve dist/storybook &`, Step 3 = `pnpm e2e:storybook`. Never run against a live dev server.
   - **Visual regression baselines** must be captured inside CI (first run auto-accepts), not on a developer machine. Different OS font rendering invalidates cross-machine baselines.
   - Visual regression diff threshold: ≥ 0.1% pixel difference (not 0) to avoid noise from sub-pixel rendering.

3. **CSS layer order is inviolable — ADR-002:**

   - The `@layer tailwind-base, material, tailwind-utilities` order in `styles.scss` must survive the Tailwind v4 migration.
   - Migration path: use the three individual imports (`@import "tailwindcss/base"`, `@import "tailwindcss/components"`, `@import "tailwindcss/utilities"`) — NOT `@import "tailwindcss"` monolith which destroys explicit layer ordering.
   - Keep JS config (`tailwind.config.js`) for now — `@theme {}` CSS-first token migration deferred to a future epic.
   - Use `@tailwindcss/postcss` in `postcss.config.js` (not the Vite plugin) to avoid plugin-ordering conflicts with `@analogjs/vite-plugin-angular`.
   - **Production bundle verification gate (Story 6.2):** inspect the emitted production CSS bundle and verify it contains Tailwind utility class definitions from inline Angular component templates. If absent, switch to `@tailwindcss/vite` and re-validate.
   - The `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` must explicitly include `./apps/dms-material/src/**/*.ts` and `./apps/dms-material/src/**/*.html` — monorepo structure defeats Tailwind v4 auto-detection heuristics.
   - Revisit the three-import compatibility path when Tailwind publishes a deprecation notice for it.

4. **massive.com CUSIP API — ADR-003:**

   - Fallback chain after integration: OpenFIGI → massive.com → Yahoo Finance.
   - Rate limit: 5 req/min. Implement a hand-rolled interval-based throttle in `massive-cusip.service.ts` with a conservative 4.5 req/min effective rate (10% safety margin). No external queue library required.
   - **Verify before implementing (Story 2.2):** inspect `prisma/schema.prisma` and `prisma/schema.postgresql.prisma` for the `resolution_source` field on `cusip_cache`. If absent, Story 2.2 must include: add field to both schema files and create a migration. Both schemas must remain in sync.
   - Unit test must assert: OpenFIGI success short-circuits the chain (massive.com is never called when OpenFIGI resolves).
   - Add a circuit-breaker: if massive.com returns HTTP 429, fall through to Yahoo Finance immediately.
   - The three failing CUSIPs (`691543102`, `88636J527`, `88634T493`) must be added to a regression test in Story 2.4.

5. **ESLint flat config — ADR-004:**

   - Adopt new rules in staged batches: configure as `'warn'` → run `pnpm lint --fix` → commit auto-fix batch → fix remaining manually → promote to `'error'` before epic close.
   - Run `pnpm lint --fix` twice in sequence and assert idempotent output before committing (detects rule conflicts).
   - `eslint-plugin-vitest` must be pinned to a version compatible with the existing `eslint` major.
   - `vitest/no-disabled-tests` must be set to `'warn'` (not `'error'`), with a flat-config override that sets it to `'off'` for spec files containing the comment `// @atdd`. This exempts intentionally-skipped ATDD tests while surfacing accidentally-skipped tests.
   - All future ATDD stories must add `// @atdd` as the first comment in the spec file to activate this exemption.
   - Stories 4.2/4.3 (TypeScript-affecting lint rules) should be sequenced _before_ Epic 5. Any lint rules that affect template syntax should be sequenced _after_ Epic 5 completes.

6. **Epic sequencing — refined hard constraints:**

   - E1 (dead code) → E3 (enable skipped tests) → E4 TypeScript rules → E5 (CSS migration) → E4 template rules (if any) → E6 (Tailwind v4) → E7 (CUSIP cosmetics) → E8 (Storybook)
   - **E7 is a hard prerequisite for E8 Story 8.4** (visual regression baseline capture). Baselines captured before E7 cosmetic fixes are invalid — the bugs become the "correct" baseline.
   - E5 + E6 together may resolve E7 issues — Story 7.1 must verify this before adding new fixes.
   - Epic 2 (massive.com) is independent of the CSS/Storybook sequence and can run in parallel.

7. **No data integrity pattern changes** — `deletedAt`, `version` optimistic locking, and CUID PKs are out of scope for all epics.

---

### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified

- **Test suite health:** Epics 3 and 8 both affect test infrastructure. E3 must complete (suite fully green) before E8 visual baselines are captured.
- **CSS architecture:** Epics 5, 6, and 7 overlap on component stylesheets and the global SCSS layer system. Must not run in parallel on overlapping components.
- **ESLint configuration:** Epics 1 and 4 both affect which code must pass linting. E1 first reduces E4 remediation surface. E4 TypeScript rules before E5; any template syntax rules after E5.
- **CI pipeline integrity:** Epic 8 Story 8.5 modifies GitHub Actions. Must not break: lint, build, unit tests, E2E Chromium, E2E Firefox, duplicate-check, format. Storybook build should be CI-cached by source hash to avoid pipeline slowdown.
- **ATDD-first TDD ordering:** All 33 stories follow the mandatory pattern. `// @atdd` comment convention must be followed for ESLint `vitest/no-disabled-tests` exemption to apply.
- **Inline component styles audit:** Story 5.1 must scan both `.scss` files AND `styles:` arrays inside `@Component` decorators in `.ts` files — not just standalone stylesheet files.
- **Dead code deletion safety:** Story 1.1 must include a route-reference scan (not just selector scan) to catch components loaded only via dynamic `loadComponent` strings.

### Failure Mode Register

| Epic | Top Risk                                                                 | Prevention                                                                                                           |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| E1   | Deleting component used only via dynamic route string                    | Route-reference scan in Story 1.1; E2E must cover all routes                                                         |
| E2   | massive.com undocumented daily cap; `resolution_source` field absent     | Story 2.1 documents full rate-limit terms; inspect schema before Story 2.2                                           |
| E3   | Skipped test covers a real unfixed bug — unskipping swells scope         | Story 3.1 classifies: `unskip-trivial` / `unskip-needs-fix` / `delete`; `needs-fix` items spawn separate bug stories |
| E4   | `vitest/no-disabled-tests: 'error'` lands before E3 completes            | Set to `'warn'` initially; E3 must complete before promoting to `'error'`                                            |
| E5   | Tailwind classes on Material host element blocked by view encapsulation  | Test in real app with CDK harness tests, not Storybook only                                                          |
| E6   | `@analogjs` + `@tailwindcss/postcss` conflict drops CSS silently in prod | Run prod build verification gate: inspect bundle for Tailwind class definitions                                      |
| E7   | Fix uses `::ng-deep` (banned)                                            | ESLint catches it; use Material mixin or `--dms-*` variables only                                                    |
| E8   | Baselines captured before E7 fixes; cosmetic bugs become "correct"       | Hard sequencing constraint: E7 complete before E8 Story 8.4                                                          |

## Core Architectural Decisions

### Decision Priority Analysis

**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**

- ADR-001: Storybook + Angular 21 + Vite integration strategy
- ADR-002: Tailwind v4 CSS layer preservation + PostCSS integration
- ADR-003: massive.com CUSIP API rate-limit queue strategy
- ADR-004: ESLint flat config rule adoption sequence

**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**

- Epic sequencing hard constraints (E7 before E8.4, E1 before E4, E5 before E6)
- `// @atdd` comment convention for ESLint skip exemption
- Storybook CI strategy: static build → serve → Playwright (not live dev server)
- Visual regression baseline capture inside CI, not developer machines

**Deferred Decisions (Future Epics):**

- Tailwind `@theme {}` CSS-first token migration (Epic 6+ successor)
- MSW HTTP mocking in Storybook (only if EffectService mock pattern proves insufficient)
- `@tailwindcss/vite` Vite plugin (fallback in Story 6.2 only if bundle verification fails)

---

### Data Architecture

All data architecture decisions are established by the existing codebase and are not changed by
the current epic set. Reference: `docs/data-models.md`, `prisma/schema.prisma`.

- ORM: Prisma 7.2.x with better-sqlite3 adapter (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod)
- Pattern: Soft-delete (`deletedAt`), optimistic locking (`version`), CUID PKs
- Both schema files (`schema.prisma` + `schema.postgresql.prisma`) must stay in sync
- **New (Epic 2 only):** `cusip_cache.resolution_source` field must be verified and added via migration if absent before Story 2.2 implementation

---

### Authentication & Security

No changes. Existing: AWS Cognito RS256 JWT, CSRF tokens, rate limiting (100 req/15min default /
10 req/15min auth / 5 req/hr import), HTTP-only cookies, mock auth for dev.
Reference: `docs/architecture-server.md`.

---

### API & Communication Patterns

No new routes in this epic set. Existing patterns remain unchanged.

- SmartNgRX POST-by-IDs entity loading
- `x-table-state` base64 JSON header for sort/filter
- `@fastify/autoload` route auto-registration under `/api`
- **New (Epic 2 only):** massive.com service follows existing service naming convention (`massive-cusip.service.ts`) and is injected only within the CUSIP resolution chain — not exposed as a route

---

### Frontend Architecture

No new routes, components, or entities in this epic set. Existing patterns remain unchanged.
Reference: `docs/architecture-dms-material.md`, `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.

**New (Epic 8 only):**

- Storybook stories live in `apps/dms-material/src/` co-located with components as `*.stories.ts`
- Display component stories: pass data via `input()` signal values directly — no store
- Page component stories: provide mock `EffectService` via `applicationConfig({ providers: [...] })`
- Both light and dark mode variants required for every page story
- CI Storybook static bundle output: `dist/storybook/` (gitignored, CI artifact)

---

### Infrastructure & Deployment

No infrastructure changes for Epics 1–7.

**New (Epic 8):** GitHub Actions pipeline gains two new steps:

1. `pnpm storybook:build` — generate static Storybook bundle
2. `pnpm e2e:storybook` — run Playwright visual regression against served static bundle

Storybook build step should be cached in CI by source hash of `apps/dms-material/src/**` to
avoid rebuilding on unrelated changes.

---

### Decision Impact Analysis

**Implementation Sequence (enforced hard ordering):**

1. E1 (dead code removal) — reduces surface for all subsequent epics
2. E3 (enable skipped tests) — restore green test baseline
3. E4 TypeScript lint rules — before CSS migration to avoid double-remediating TS files
4. E2 (massive.com) — independent; parallelizable with E4/E5
5. E5 (CSS → Tailwind migration) — prerequisite for E6 and E7
6. E4 template lint rules (if any) — after E5
7. E6 (Tailwind v4 upgrade) — after E5 class names are normalised
8. E7 (CUSIP cosmetics) — after E5+E6 may already resolve issues; hard prerequisite for E8.4
9. E8 (Storybook + visual regression) — last; requires green suite and resolved cosmetics

**Cross-Component Dependencies:**

- E4's `vitest/no-disabled-tests: 'warn'` setting depends on E3 completing before promotion to `'error'`
- E8 Story 8.4 (baseline capture) is invalidated if E7 is incomplete — cosmetic bugs become the "correct" baseline
- E6 Story 6.2 has a go/no-go verification gate: if prod bundle lacks Tailwind classes from inline templates, switch integration approach before proceeding

---

## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules

_Patterns that must be applied uniformly across all 33 stories to prevent contradictions between epics._

---

### 1. Naming Patterns

**E2 — CUSIP resolution_source values**

The `resolution_source` column in `cusip_cache` uses these exact string literals only:

| Value        | Meaning                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `'openfigi'` | Resolved via OpenFIGI API           |
| `'massive'`  | Resolved via massive.com            |
| `'yahoo'`    | Resolved via Yahoo Finance fallback |
| `null`       | Not yet attempted                   |

> **Verify-before-implement constraint:** Confirm `resolution_source` column exists in the current `cusip_cache` schema (Prisma schema or migration files) before writing any E2 story code. If absent, create a schema migration as E2 Story 1.

**E8 — Storybook file naming**

```
{ComponentName}.stories.ts          # co-located with component
title: '{Feature}/{ComponentName}'  # e.g. 'Holdings/HoldingsTableComponent'
story export name: PascalCase        # e.g. Default, DarkTheme, EmptyState
```

**E2 — massive.com service naming**

- File: `massive-cusip.service.ts`
- Class: `MassiveCusipService`
- All methods: named functions only (no arrow functions assigned to properties)
- Throttle helper: named `throttledFetch` (or similar explicit name — no inline anonymous)

---

### 2. Structure Patterns

**E1 — Dead component classification (5 criteria)**

A component is classified "dead" only when ALL five conditions are true:

1. Zero `import` references in any `*.ts` file
2. Not declared in any `NgModule` (N/A for standalone, but check anyway)
3. Not registered in any router `loadComponent` or `loadChildren`
4. Not referenced in any `*.html` template
5. Not referenced in any Storybook `*.stories.ts` file

If any one condition is false → the component is NOT dead; exclude from deletion list.

**E3 — ATDD spec file first-line convention**

Every ATDD acceptance-test spec file must begin with a `// @atdd` comment on line 1:

```typescript
// @atdd
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
// ...
```

This marker enables:

- ESLint override: allows `it.skip` / `xit` within `// @atdd` files (ADR-004)
- Tooling grep: `grep -r '@atdd' apps/` to enumerate all acceptance tests
- CI gate: count of `@atdd` files must not decrease between commits

**E8 — Storybook directory structure**

```
apps/dms-material/src/
  app/
    {feature}/
      {component}/
        {component}.component.ts
        {component}.component.html  (or inline template)
        {component}.stories.ts       ← co-located here
  .storybook/
    main.ts                          ← Vite builder config + Angular plugin
    preview.ts                       ← global decorators, BrowserAnimationsModule
    tsconfig.json                    ← extends root, includes stories glob
```

---

### 3. Format Patterns

**E5 — CSS audit document table format**

The audit document produced in E5 Story 1 must use this column format:

| Component                | File                            | Current Style     | Type   | Proposed Tailwind Class |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| `HoldingsTableComponent` | `holdings-table.component.scss` | `margin-top: 8px` | layout | `mt-2`                  |

- **Type** values: `layout` \| `spacing` \| `typography` \| `color` \| `other`
- **Proposed Tailwind Class**: must reference Tailwind v3 class names (migration happens in E5; v4 upgrade in E6)
- Color classes must be left blank with note "Managed by Angular Material" — do not migrate

**E8 — Storybook mock provider pattern**

Services with HTTP dependencies must be mocked using `applicationConfig`, not TestBed:

```typescript
// CORRECT — applicationConfig pattern
import { applicationConfig } from '@angular/core';

export const Default: Story = {
  decorators: [
    applicationConfig({
      providers: [{ provide: HoldingsService, useClass: MockHoldingsService }],
    }),
  ],
};

// WRONG — do not use
import { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing'; // ← never in stories
```

**E4 — lint-rules-diff.md column format**

| Rule                                 | Old Setting | New Setting | Rationale           | Files to Fix |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` | `warn`      | `error`     | Enforce type safety | 12           |

---

### 4. Process Patterns

**E4 — Lint rule adoption sequence (per rule batch)**

Each lint rule change must follow this 5-step sequence before moving to the next rule:

1. **Document** — add row to `lint-rules-diff.md`
2. **Configure** — set rule to `'warn'` in `eslint.config.mjs`
3. **Fix all warnings** — resolve every existing violation
4. **Promote** — change rule to `'error'`
5. **Commit** — one atomic commit per rule batch: `feat(lint): promote {rule-name} to error`

Never batch multiple rule promotions in a single commit.

**E1 — Dead code deletion validation loop**

For each candidate component identified in the scan:

1. Verify all 5 classification criteria (see Structure Patterns above)
2. Run `pnpm nx run dms-material:build` — confirm no build errors
3. Run `pnpm nx run dms-material:test` — confirm test count ≥ pre-deletion baseline
4. Commit individually: `chore(cleanup): remove dead {ComponentName}`

Never batch-delete multiple components in a single commit.

**E5/E6 — Tailwind migration granularity**

- Migrate one component per commit during E5: `style(tailwind): migrate {ComponentName} to utility classes`
- E6 upgrade is a single commit after all E5 migrations are complete: `chore(tailwind): upgrade to v4`
- CSS audit document must be committed before any migration begins

---

### 5. Enforcement Guidelines

**All agents MUST:**

- Check `resolution_source` column existence before writing E2 code
- Apply the `// @atdd` first-line convention to every new ATDD spec file
- Use the 5-criterion dead-component checklist before recommending deletion
- Use `applicationConfig` (never TestBed) in Storybook stories
- Follow the 5-step lint promotion sequence; never batch rule changes
- Migrate one Tailwind component per commit during E5
- Verify E7 is fully complete before running E8 Story 8.4 baseline capture

**Anti-patterns (never do these):**

| Anti-Pattern                                                            | Epic | Correct Pattern                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Batch-delete multiple dead components in one commit                     | E1   | One component per commit, validated individually |
| Add color Tailwind classes during E5 migration                          | E5   | Leave color to Angular Material; layout only     |

### 6. Virtual Scroll & Sticky Header Guardrails

**One-line summary:** Never apply CSS layout containment (`contain: paint`, `contain: layout`, `contain: strict`, `contain: content`) to `.cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport` or any of its ancestors — doing so breaks `position: sticky` on CDK table headers in all browsers implementing CSS Containment Level 2 (Chrome 114+, Firefox 109+).

#### Root Cause (Epic 101 — Round 7)

[Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/101-2-root-cause-and-fix-scrolling.md#Root-Cause-Investigation]

The confirmed root cause (Round 7 / Epic 101) was `contain: paint` on `.virtual-scroll-viewport` inside `base-table.component.scss`. As of CSS Containment Level 2 (Chrome 114+, Firefox 109+), `contain: paint` implies `contain: layout`. An element with layout containment creates an **independent formatting context (IFC)**, which is a containing-block boundary. `position: sticky` with `top: 0` anchors to the nearest scroll container that is NOT an IFC ancestor. When `.virtual-scroll-viewport` (which is the scroll container) also became an IFC via `contain: paint → contain: layout`, the sticky resolver could not find a valid scroll container to anchor against. It computed offsets relative to the IFC root instead, causing the table header to drift during 4px/16ms slow programmatic scroll.

`contain: paint` was added in Epic 31 to replace `contain: strict` — it was correct at the time (pre-CSS Containment Level 2). The browser spec change in Chrome 114 / Firefox 109 silently made it harmful.

**Evidence:** CDK's `transform: translateY()` on `.cdk-virtual-scroll-content-wrapper` updates on each scroll frame. The browser's sticky-position resolver fires between CDK transform updates, producing frames where the header's computed Y differs from the viewport's Y by `PIXEL_TOLERANCE` (2px).

**Fix applied:** Removed `contain: paint` from `.virtual-scroll-viewport` in `apps/dms-material/src/app/shared/components/base-table/base-table.component.scss`. `overflow: auto` on the same element already provides the paint boundary CDK needs. The explicit `contain` property was redundant and harmful.

#### Patterns to Avoid

The following CSS properties, when applied to `.cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport` or **any ancestor element** in the scroll chain, break `position: sticky` on CDK table headers:

| Property / Value | Effect | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contain: paint` | Implies `contain: layout` in CSS Containment Level 2; creates IFC | ✅ Confirmed root cause — Epic 101 |
| `contain: layout` | Creates IFC directly; breaks sticky containing block | ✅ Implied by root cause |
| `contain: strict` | Implies layout + paint; creates IFC | ✅ Was root cause — Epic 31 |
| `contain: content` | Implies layout + paint; creates IFC | ✅ Avoid |
| `transform` | Creates new stacking context and containing block | ⚠️ Candidate A (documented risk; not confirmed as active in Round 7) |
| `will-change: transform` | Same effect as `transform` in most browsers | ⚠️ Candidate A |
| `filter` | Creates new stacking context | ⚠️ Documented risk; not confirmed |
| `perspective` | Creates new stacking context | ⚠️ Documented risk; not confirmed |
| `backdrop-filter` | Creates new stacking context | ⚠️ Documented risk; not confirmed |

**Structural constraint (do not violate):**

> `.virtual-scroll-viewport` MUST be a scroll container (`overflow-y: auto`) but MUST NOT apply layout containment (`contain: layout` or any shorthand that implies it, including `contain: paint` in CSS Containment Level 2 browsers). CDK virtual scroll positions visible rows using `transform: translateY()` on `.cdk-virtual-scroll-content-wrapper`; `position: sticky` on `<th>` elements inside must anchor to the scrollport (the viewport element), not to the transformed subtree. Any containment that creates an independent formatting context on the viewport element will break this invariant in browsers implementing CSS Containment Level 2 (Chrome 114+, Firefox 109+).

> [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/101-2-root-cause-and-fix-scrolling.md#Hand-off-Note-for-Story-101.3]

**Additional guardrails:**

- `overflow: auto` on `.virtual-scroll-viewport` is sufficient as a paint boundary for CDK — do not add any explicit `contain` property to this element.
- If a future refactor adds a Tailwind utility class or SCSS rule that applies any of the above properties to a scroll ancestor, verify sticky behavior first using a 4px/16ms slow-scroll test across all five virtual-scrolled screens before merging.
- Tailwind ring/shadow utilities (`ring-*`, `shadow-*`) are safe — none apply layout containment.

#### Reproduction Matrix (Story 101.1)

[Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/101-1-reproduce-scrolling-all-screens.md#Dev-Notes]

Five virtual-scrolled screens were confirmed in Round 7 (all share `<dms-base-table>` / `base-table.component.scss` as the root of the CSS bug):

| Screen | Component | Round 7 Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Universe | `global-universe.component` | header-scrolls-with-content, header-under-header |
| Open Positions | `open-positions.component` | header-scrolls-with-content, header-under-header |
| Sold Positions | `sold-positions.component` | header-scrolls-with-content, header-under-header |
| Dividend Deposits | `dividend-deposits.component` | header-scrolls-with-content, header-under-header |
| Screener | `global-screener.component` | header-scrolls-with-content, header-under-header |

All five screens were resolved by removing `contain: paint` from the single shared SCSS file.

#### Regression Suite (Story 101.3)

[Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/101-3-scrolling-regression-suite.md#Implementation-Notes]

The permanent regression suite that prevents reintroduction of the `contain`/sticky breakage:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/dms-material-e2e/src/helpers/assert-sticky-header-invariant.helper.ts` | CSS guard (`contain` must be absent or `none`) + geometric invariant assertions |
| `apps/dms-material-e2e/src/helpers/slow-scroll.helper.ts` | RAF-based 4px/16ms slow-scroll driver |
| `apps/dms-material-e2e/src/universe-scrolling-regression.spec.ts` | Universe — 101.3 regression block |
| `apps/dms-material-e2e/src/open-positions-scrolling-regression.spec.ts` | Open Positions — 101.3 regression block |
| `apps/dms-material-e2e/src/sold-positions-scrolling-regression.spec.ts` | Sold Positions — 101.3 regression block |
| `apps/dms-material-e2e/src/div-deposits-scrolling-regression.spec.ts` | Dividend Deposits — 101.3 regression block |
| `apps/dms-material-e2e/src/screener-scrolling-regression.spec.ts` | Screener — new in 101.3 |

**Key assertion per frame during 4px/16ms slow scroll:**

```typescript
abs(header.getBoundingClientRect().top - viewport.getBoundingClientRect().top) <= 2
```

where `header` = the `<thead>` / `mat-header-row`, `viewport` = `cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport`, and `2` is `PIXEL_TOLERANCE` (subpixel-rounding tolerance). The helper also asserts that `getComputedStyle(viewport).contain` is `'none'` or unset.

#### Prior Epic History (Back-Pointer)

Seven rounds of scrolling artifacts led to this fix. This section exists so Round 8 never starts.

[Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/101-1-reproduce-scrolling-all-screens.md#Prior-Root-Cause-History]

| Epic | Round | Symptom Targeted | Why Symptoms Returned |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 29 | 1 | `rowHeight` mismatch — CDK total scroll height wrong | Reduced symptoms; `contain` issue persisted |
| 31 | 2 | `contain: strict` on header → jump on viewport recalc | Replaced with `contain: paint` (safe pre-Containment Level 2) |
| 44 | 3 | CSS transitions + extra CD cycles → CDK recalc mid-scroll | Reduced symptoms; `contain` issue persisted |
| 60 | 4 | `isLoading` filter shrank array → CDK recalculated total height | Reduced symptoms; `contain` issue persisted |
| 64 | 5 | Edge case of Epic 60 (different code path) | Reduced symptoms; `contain` issue persisted |
| 87 | 6 | Placeholder rows had `symbol: ''` → blank cells during fast scroll | Fixed fast-scroll blank cells; `contain: paint` triggered slow-scroll drift |
| **101** | **7** | **`contain: paint` on `.virtual-scroll-viewport` → slow-scroll sticky drift** | **Root cause eliminated** |

The structural constraint that made this area recurrence-prone: every Epic 31–87 patch removed or masked one symptom but left `contain: paint` on `.virtual-scroll-viewport` intact, because the CSS Containment Level 2 behavior change (Chrome 114 / Firefox 109) was not yet observed.

### Architectural Boundaries

**API Boundaries:**

| Boundary               | Location                               | Protocol                             | Auth                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend → Backend     | `apps/server/src/app/routes/`          | REST/JSON over HTTPS                 | AWS Cognito JWT (RS256) in HTTP-only cookie       |
| Backend → AWS Cognito  | `plugins/auth`                         | HTTPS/JWKS                           | RS256 public key verification                     |
| Backend → OpenFIGI     | `routes/admin/cusip-cache/`            | HTTPS REST                           | API key in header                                 |
| Backend → massive.com  | `utils/massive-cusip.service.ts` ← NEW | HTTPS REST                           | API key in header; 4.5 req/min throttle (ADR-003) |
| Backend → Prisma       | `app/prisma/`                          | Local (SQLite dev / PostgreSQL prod) | TLS in prod                                       |
| Storybook → Components | `.storybook/` ← NEW                    | In-process (Vite dev server)         | None (mocked providers)                           |

**Component Boundaries:**

- **Feature modules** are flat directories under `apps/dms-material/src/app/{feature}/` — each self-contained (standalone components, no NgModules)
- **Shared components** live in `apps/dms-material/src/app/shared/` — imported directly by feature components; no barrel re-exports
- **State**: `apps/dms-material/src/app/store/` — SmartNgRX `@smarttools/smart-signals` entity stores; signals flow down to components, user events flow up via `EffectService<T>`
- **Server routes** are co-located with their handlers under `apps/server/src/app/routes/{domain}/` — no shared route barrels

**Data Boundaries:**

| Layer             | Technology                                | Location                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Persistence       | Prisma + SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod) | `apps/server/src/app/prisma/`            |
| Server-side cache | In-memory (rate-limit store)              | Fastify plugin                           |
| Client-side state | SmartNgRX signals                         | `apps/dms-material/src/app/store/`       |
| Auth tokens       | HTTP-only cookies (never localStorage)    | Browser ↔ Server                         |
| Test database     | SQLite fixture                            | `apps/dms-material-e2e/test-database.db` |

### Integration Points

**Internal Communication:**

- Angular components → SmartNgRX store via `inject(EffectService)` (signal-based; no constructor injection)
- Fastify routes → Services via `@fastify/autoload` DI pattern
- E2 resolution chain: `cusip-cache-cleanup.service.ts` → OpenFIGI → `massive-cusip.service.ts` → Yahoo Finance fallback

**External Integrations:**

| Integration        | Direction           | Rate Limit               | Error Strategy                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| OpenFIGI API       | Server outbound     | None specified           | Retry × 3, then massive.com             |
| massive.com CUSIP  | Server outbound     | 5 req/min (4.5 enforced) | Hand-rolled throttle queue; skip on 429 |
| Yahoo Finance      | Server outbound     | Unspecified              | Last-resort fallback only               |
| AWS Cognito (JWKS) | Server inbound-auth | N/A                      | Reject on verification failure          |

**E2 CUSIP Resolution Data Flow:**

```
POST /api/admin/cusip-cache/resolve
  → cusip-cache-cleanup.service.ts
    → [check DB cache]
      → if miss: OpenFIGI lookup
          → if fail: massive-cusip.service.ts (throttled, 4.5/min)
              → if fail: Yahoo Finance fallback
                  → write result + resolution_source to cusip_cache table
```

## Quality Tool Governance

This section defines the rules for configuring and maintaining the quality enforcement tools in the workspace. All tools run as part of `pnpm all` or as separate CI steps; every check must pass before a story is considered done.

### jscpd (Code Duplication)

**Config file:** `.jscpd.json`
**CI command:** `pnpm dupcheck`
**Threshold:** 0% — zero tolerance for code duplication across the scanned codebase

**Rules:**

- Every path in the `ignore` array must resolve to an existing file or directory in the repository. Invalid (non-existent) paths must be removed immediately.
- Duplication violations must be resolved by refactoring duplicated code into shared utilities, services, or base abstractions — never by adding new suppression entries to the `ignore` array.
- The `ignore` array may only contain infrastructure/config patterns (e.g., `node_modules`, `dist`, `coverage`, spec files, config files) and generated output directories (e.g., `_bmad-output`, `docs`). Application source code paths must not be suppressed.
- When new shared code is extracted, each file must export exactly one item (per the `@smarttools/one-exported-item-per-file` ESLint rule) and include a corresponding spec file if it contains non-trivial logic.

### Vitest (Unit Test Coverage)

**Config file:** `vitest.config.ts` (root), per-project configs in `apps/*/vitest.config.ts`
**CI command:** runs as part of `pnpm all` via `nx affected -t test --coverage`
**Thresholds:** 100% for `branches`, `functions`, `lines`, and `statements`

**Rules:**

- Coverage thresholds must not be lowered. All four metrics (branches, functions, lines, statements) must remain at 100%.
- `/* v8 ignore next */` (or `/* v8 ignore start/stop */`) comments are only permitted for provably unreachable branches (e.g., TypeScript exhaustive switch default cases). Each ignore comment must include an explanatory comment on the preceding line stating why the branch is unreachable.
- The `exclude` list in the coverage config must not be modified to hide coverage gaps in application source code. Only test infrastructure, config files, type definitions, and build artifacts may be excluded.
- Tests run through Nx (`npx nx test <project> --coverage`), not directly via the `vitest` CLI, to ensure project-level isolation and correct configuration.

### ESLint (Static Analysis)

**Config file:** `eslint.config.mjs` (root), per-project configs in `apps/*/eslint.config.mjs`
**CI command:** runs as part of `pnpm all` via `nx affected -t lint`

**Rules:**

- `eslint-disable` suppression comments (inline or block) require a brief justification comment explaining why the rule is disabled for that specific line or block.
- New ESLint rules or rule changes must be documented in `docs/lint-rules-diff.md` with the rule name, old severity, new severity, and rationale.
- The `@smarttools/one-exported-item-per-file` rule is enforced workspace-wide: every TypeScript file must export exactly one item. No exceptions without documented justification.

### Prettier (Code Formatting)

**CI command:** `pnpm format` (runs `prettier --write .` followed by verification)

**Rules:**

- All committed code must pass `pnpm format` without changes. Run `pnpm format` before committing.
- Prettier configuration is workspace-level only. Per-file or per-directory overrides are not permitted.

### Governance Enforcement

All quality checks are enforced through the CI pipeline. The `pnpm all` command runs lint, build, and test (with coverage) for all affected projects. Additionally, `pnpm dupcheck` and `pnpm format` run as separate steps. Every story's Definition of Done requires all checks to pass. No PR may be merged with failing quality gates.

## Architecture Validation Results

### Coherence Validation ✅

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ADR-001 (Storybook 8 + `@analogjs/vite-plugin-angular`) + Angular 21 standalone                                 | ✅          | Vite builder shares same plugin; no zone.js in either path                        |
| ADR-002 (Tailwind v4 three-import path) + CSS layer rule (`@layer tailwind-base, material, tailwind-utilities`) | ✅          | Three-import approach preserves layer order; v4 compatible                        |
| ADR-003 (massive.com 4.5 req/min throttle) + Fastify rate-limit plugin                                          | ✅          | Separate concerns — Fastify rate-limit guards inbound; throttle controls outbound |
| ADR-004 (`// @atdd` ESLint override) + `vitest/no-disabled-tests: 'error'`                                      | ✅          | Override scoped to `*.atdd.spec.ts` pattern only; unit tests unaffected           |
| E7 hard prerequisite for E8.4 + implementation sequence table                                                   | ✅          | Documented in both Step 4 (sequence) and Step 5 (process pattern) — consistent    |
| SmartNgRX `inject()` pattern + zoneless `provideZonelessChangeDetection()`                                      | ✅          | Signal-based store is zoneless-safe; no zone.js triggers needed                   |

No contradictory decisions found.

**Pattern Consistency:**

- Naming patterns align with file structure: `massive-cusip.service.ts` placed at `apps/server/src/app/utils/`; `{component}.stories.ts` co-located with components ✅
- `// @atdd` first-line convention, ESLint override (ADR-004), and CI gate definition are mutually reinforcing ✅
- One-commit-per-component granularity rule appears in both E1 (dead code) and E5 (Tailwind migration) — consistent ✅

**Structure Alignment:**

- `.storybook/main.ts` uses same Vite/Angular plugin as `vite.config.ts` — supported by ADR-001 ✅
- `docs/lint-rules-diff.md` and `docs/css-tailwind-audit.md` are defined as new files in Step 6; their column formats are defined in Step 5 — consistent ✅

### Implementation Readiness Validation ✅

**Decision Completeness:**
All 4 ADRs include problem statement, chosen option, rationale, and implications. Implementation sequence with hard ordering is documented. go/no-go gate for E6 Story 6.2 is explicit.

**Structure Completeness:**
Complete directory tree with all existing and new files. All 8 new files explicitly named with epic attribution. Integration boundaries and data flow diagram for E2 included.

**Pattern Completeness:**
All 9 identified conflict points are addressed. Anti-patterns table covers 6 failure modes. Process patterns include step-by-step sequences, not just descriptions.

---

### Gap Analysis Results

**Critical Gaps:** None.

**Important Gaps:**

> **GAP-1 — `massive-cusip.service.ts` canonical location**
> Canonical path is `apps/server/src/app/utils/massive-cusip.service.ts` (inner `app/utils/`, consistent with existing services). Not `apps/server/src/utils/` (outer level).

> **GAP-2 — Storybook Playwright `baseURL`** > `storybook-visual.spec.ts` targets the Storybook dev server (`http://localhost:6006`). E8 Story 8.4 implementation must add a `storybook` project entry to `playwright.config.ts` with the appropriate `baseURL` override.

**Nice-to-Have Gaps:**

> **GAP-3 — Storybook Nx targets** > `apps/dms-material/project.json` will need `storybook` and `build-storybook` Nx targets. Added as part of E8 Story 8.1 setup — not blocking, but implementation agents should expect to add them.

### Architecture Readiness Assessment

**Overall Status: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

**Confidence Level: High** — all epics have full architectural support; all 4 ADRs resolve previously uncertain decisions; two important gaps are self-contained with documented resolutions.

**Key Strengths:**

- Epic sequencing is fully enforced with hard constraints (E7 → E8.4; E3 → E4 lint promotion)
- The `// @atdd` convention bridges E3 (test repair), E4 (lint exception), and E8 (acceptance baseline) coherently
- Failure Mode Register gives implementation agents pre-computed rollback strategies per epic
- All verify-before-implement checks are named and located (`resolution_source`, E6 go/no-go gate)

**Areas for Future Enhancement (post-epic scope):**

- Nx module boundaries (`@nx/enforce-module-boundaries`) — natural next step after E4
- Storybook interaction tests (`@storybook/addon-interactions`) — extends E8 without architectural conflict
- PostgreSQL migration testing in CI — currently only SQLite tested locally

### Implementation Handoff — AI Agent Guidelines

1. Follow implementation sequence: E1 → E3 → E4(TS rules) → E2 → E5 → E4(template rules) → E6 → E7 → E8
2. Apply `// @atdd` to every new acceptance test spec (line 1)
3. Use `applicationConfig` (never TestBed) in all Storybook stories
4. Verify `resolution_source` column exists in Prisma schema before writing E2 code
5. Place `massive-cusip.service.ts` at `apps/server/src/app/utils/` (not `src/utils/`)
6. Do not capture E8 Story 8.4 baseline until E7 is fully merged and green
7. For E6 Story 6.2: run go/no-go bundle check before proceeding with Vite plugin swap
